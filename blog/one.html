   <h1>Inspiration</h1>
   <!-- Starting in force in October, hundreds of cruising sailboats or cruisers (as they are known) arrive in Opua to escape the cyclone season in the south pacific. -->
   <!---->
   <!-- Some of the sailors stay only a short time to clear in and lick their wounds from the (often difficult) one thousand nautical mile passage from the islands. -->
   <!---->
   <!-- Others, enamoured by the natural beauty, hospitality and lifestyle of NZ never leave.  -->
   <!---->
   <!-- I had discovered Opua not from the sea like so many others but instead from an internet advertisement of a sailboat which I had (rather impulsively) made an offer on. -->
   <!---->
   <!-- The first time I had ever been aboard a sailboat had also been under rather impulsive conditions. I was visiting my dad in Golden Bay, at the top of the South Island. When some friends off his partner (who were cruising in their own boat) came to pick her up for a week long sailing trip, my dad and I were dropping her off at the dock when they asked if I would like to come along. -->
   <!---->
   <!-- With only the clothes on my back we departed on what would be a fairly transformative trip. -->
   <!---->
   <!-- As there was almost no wind (in fact the whole trip featured almost no actual sailing) we set out under diesel power. Feeling somewhat motion sick I was quickly put to work on the helm. Something I still consider to be the most effective remedy to the mal de mer.  -->
   <!---->
   <!-- I was taught how to steer to a landmark, or a compass bearing and quickly became comfortable aboard. -->
   <!---->
   <!-- I learned of the various systems aboard that made life off-the-grid possible. The batteries and generator to provide electricity, the tanks and desalinator for providing water and even the head (toilet) which most of the rules aboard centered around. -->
   <!---->
   <!-- All the systems make a certain life possible, that is, like a snail to travel slowly but always have your home and it's relative comfort with you. This was an idea that would take hold in my mind and would lead me, some twenty years later to buying a slighly tired sloop with money I didn't have and basically no practical idea how to sail, or maintain a large and needy sailboat. -->
