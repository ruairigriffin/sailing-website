   <!-- Hi Mike, -->
   <!---->
   <!-- I'd like to make an offer on Auspice, -->
   <!---->
   <!-- ~~~ -->
   <!---->
   <!-- Six days later, Amirah and I stepped aboard Auspice for the first time. -->
   <!---->
   <!-- Travelling nearly eight hours north to the Bay of Islands we arrived in the marina. It was hot, muggy and felt like we had stepped into the tropics. -->
   <!---->
   <!-- We had a walk around the docks, looking at different boats and hoping to catch a glimpse of Auspice. We had arranged to meet Mike (the broker) a few hours later, so resigned to waiting we drove our van 10 minutes up the road to the campsite I had booked for the week. -->
   <!---->
   <!---->
   <!-- Our van was a high roof Ford Transit which I had spent the last couple of years converting from a bare shell into a comfortable base for our adventures. I had even spent several months living in the van while working in an attempt to save money on rent. While the savings were never realised, converting and living in the van had developed many useful skills which I hoped would help ease the transition to life aboard. -->
   <!---->
   <!-- A few minutes before two, we wandered up to the gate of the pier to meet Mike. I'd spoken to Mike on the phone, he was a cheery ex-olympic sailor. -->
   <!---->
   <!-- Mike introduced himself and led us through the gate and down the dock to get our first impression of Auspice. -->
   <!---->
   <!-- Auspice is a 40 foot long, racer cruiser designed by the late Carl Schumacher and built in the early 90s. She is relatively narrow, with attractive lines and a reverse sheer stern. Among the other boats on the pier she seemed slight, but nevertheless the thought of manouvering her out of the marina on our own was intimidating. -->
   <!---->
   <!-- Mike of course could sense our naivety, he explained to us to take off our shoes before stepping aboard. -->
   <!---->
   <!-- Once aboard, Mike started showing us the various systems on deck. The large stainless steel steering wheel which had first caught my eye on the internet listing. The main sheet and traveller, a six-to-one purchase in front of the wheel. The six cockpit winches and two at the mast. A new dodger, a new mainsheet cover. The morse engine controls which (were a bit stiff). The lines were, even to the untrained eye, heavily worn and aesthetically there were many imperfections. I was happy soaking in everything I heard, Amirah eyed me (very understandably) somewhat nervously. -->
